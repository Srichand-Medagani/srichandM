# Travel / Geography

- I am originally from Telangana which is in the southern part of India. I have been to every part of India including Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Banglore, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Kolkata, Delhi, Jammu, Uttar Pradesh, etc. Every state in India has it's own culture, language, way of life which makes India a diversified yet a united country.
- Since 2022, I have been in the US for my masters. I have travelled to Newyork city, New Jersey, Niagara, Washington DC, Florida, Dallas, Oklahoma. I have loved travelling in the US. I was mesmerised by the fireworks at the monument on the auspisious day of independence in DC. 
- Apart from the big societies in the busy areas of the US, I have loved roaming the country side. I loved the wine at the wineyards which are located in the country side of Maryland.
